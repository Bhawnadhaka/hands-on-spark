# ðŸ”¥ Spark Learning Journey

A collection of personal notebooks documenting my Apache Spark learning adventure.

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks created during my self-study of Apache Spark. These materials are for learning purposes only and showcase my hands-on exploration of Spark's capabilities.

## Topics Covered

* Spark DataFrame operations
* Spark SQL and query execution
* Data frame creation techniques
* Caching strategies and performance optimization
* Managed vs External tables
* Text preprocessing with Spark
* Writing data to Spark
* Spark DataFrame (sparkdf) fundamentals
* Repartition vs Coalesce operations
* Schema enforcement
* Higher-level APIs
* ReduceByKey and GroupBy operations
* Narrow vs Wide transformations

## Learning Approach

My approach focuses on practical experimentation rather than theory alone. Each notebook represents concepts I've implemented to solidify my understanding of big data processing with Spark.

## Key Takeaways

* Spark's in-memory processing provides significant performance advantages
* Understanding transformation laziness is crucial for optimization
* Proper partitioning dramatically impacts processing efficiency
* Data skew handling is essential for real-world applications

## Future Directions

I plan to explore Spark Streaming, MLlib, and integration with cloud platforms as I continue this learning journey.
